# About

> What's this all about?

It's my HTB write-up collection.


> Who are you?

I have many names, but to make it easier, let's just say I'm a member of Petir Cyber Security team.


> So why bother creating a website if you hate WebDev so much?

I have to get the write-ups out there one way or another because if I don't, my team will think I'm a lazy f*ck and I can't risk getting my ass banned.

> Why not use the [petircysec](https://petircysec.com) blog?

The formatting is extremely unsightly and I prefer to have a larger limitation than a Wordpress with a few plugins.


> Why Github Pages?

It's the easiest out there and it fits my needs.


> When will the content be updated?

As soon as I solve a new machine, I'll create the write-up and upload it here. Note that I'm still a beginner in VulnBox games, so if you have questions, critics, or anything, you can contact me by email.
