Welcome to my HTB Write-Ups Collection (and some other stuff). I made this Jekyll-themed Github Pages because there's nothing I hate more in Computer Science than Web Development and Calculus, and I'm trying to work on the later.

This site will contain all the write-ups from HTB machines that I've solved and retired, in English and Indonesian.
```
Enjoy yourself.

By the way, pay homage to our website at [Petir](https://petircysec.com) for CTF write-ups in Indonesian.
