Does the site look ugly? Good, 'cos I wasn't trying to emphasize my site. It's the content that I want you to look. I made this Jekyll-themed Github Page because the Wordpress my team used are fugly. It doesn't format my write-ups the way I wanted. So here we are.
My write-ups will be written in English and Indonesian. Why? So my people who don't understand English yet can still learn, as intended by my ancestors in the team.

By the way, pay homage to our website at [Petir](https://petircysec.com) for CTF write-ups because I only do boxes.
