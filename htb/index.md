You should know a few things before you read further. 

These write-ups are **not the only way** to solve the machine, they're just **my way**. I created the write-ups to explain how I think, how I arrive at a solution, and I'll try to explain why. If you found easier, more complicated, or even edgier methods, good for you.

You may share my write-ups, you don't have to include my name(s) everywhere but at least you can try to show some courtesy by not discrediting me completely.

If you have a question or two, hit me up on Telegram **@takaya1337**.
<br>

So that's it, have a good time.

> Special notes for you **special snowflakes**, by my experience have I witnessed firsthand your tendency to ask questions which a few keyboard clicks of Google search can answer easily. And I mean **easily**.
>
> But remember this, when you ask a question (especially a technical one) you're dealing with a human in the other end, not a search engine. You can watch this YouTube video to further understand what I mean: **_[LiveOverflow's Guide to Ask Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53zkBvL4ZB4)_**. So, think before you type.

> And one more thing, before you ask something like "I would like to start learning this, but I don't know where to start, where can I find the right material for it?", here's my answer: **the Internet is not a small place. Get your questions right, and the answers will most likely be the same.**

For obvious reasons, the flags shown in my write-ups will be censored in a way, some only partially just to show that the flag is true, while the rest will be completely taken out (with `mspaint.exe` of course). So if you see a `cat user.txt` or `type user.txt` with just an empty line below it, you can be sure that the flag has been cut off. No flags stealing allowed, even on retired machines.
