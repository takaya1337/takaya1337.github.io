# Disclaimer

You should know a few things before you read further. These write-ups are **not the only way** to solve the machine, they're just **my way**. I created the write-ups to explain how I think, and how I arrive at a solution, and I'm going to try real hard to explain the "why". If you found easier, more complicated, or even edgier methods, good for you. If you feel the need to inform me, contact me by e-mail. 
You may share my write-ups, you don't have to include my name(s) in written forms but at least have the courtesy to whisper them to your friends for credits.
<br>

So that's it, have a good time.

> Special notes for you "special snowflakes", by my experience I have witnessed firsthand your tendency to ask questions which a few keyboard clicks of Google search can answer easily. If you really have to ask, I'll be more than happy to help. But remember this, when you ask a question (especially a technical one) you're dealing with a human in the other end, not a search engine. You can watch this YouTube video to further understand what I mean: **_[LiveOverflow's Guide to Ask Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53zkBvL4ZB4)_**. So, think before you type.
