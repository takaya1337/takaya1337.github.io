# Disclaimer

You should know a few things before you read further. 

These write-ups are **not the only way** to solve the machine, they're just **my way**. I created the write-ups to explain how I think, how I arrive at a solution, and I'll try to explain why. If you found easier, more complicated, or even edgier methods, good for you. If you feel the need to inform me, contact me by e-mail. 

You may share my write-ups, you don't have to include my name(s) everywhere but at least you may show the courtesy by not discrediting me completely.
<br>

So that's it, have a good time.

> Special notes for you "special snowflakes", by my experience I have witnessed firsthand your tendency to ask questions which a few keyboard clicks of Google search can answer easily. If you really have to ask, I'll be more than happy to help.

> But remember this, when you ask a question (especially a technical one) you're dealing with a human in the other end, not a search engine. You can watch this YouTube video to further understand what I mean: **_[LiveOverflow's Guide to Ask Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53zkBvL4ZB4)_**. So, think before you type.
